# User template notes (Galascribe-internal)

This file, and the rest of `.user-template/`, is for Galascribe's own generation
step. It is not part of a generated publication repository: Galascribe
deletes `.user-template/` in the identity commit it makes immediately after
generating a new repository from this user template, so a person writing an
article never sees it.

## Placeholders Galascribe must rewrite

Every value below is schema-valid as shipped (so the user template passes
`.user-template/scripts/verify-user-template.mjs` unmodified), but it is a stand-in.
Galascribe must replace all of them when it generates a repository for a
real publication.

Stable ids above follow the schema's UUIDv7-shaped pattern
(`^[0-9a-f]{8}-[0-9a-f]{4}-7[0-9a-f]{3}-[89ab][0-9a-f]{3}-[0-9a-f]{12}$`); a
real generation must mint real UUIDv7 values, not reuse these placeholders,
and must never reuse a placeholder value across two generated repositories.

## `content/` layout: a known, current limitation

The product spec's recommended DEC-006 layout groups content under
`content/articles/` and `content/pages/`. As of this user template's creation,
`publish-action`'s own repository-intake step
(`packages/publish-action/src/normalize/repository-intake.js`) documents a
scope reduction: it reads `content/*.md` directly and does not evaluate
`repository.json`'s `contentRoots` globs or recurse into subdirectories.
This user template therefore keeps both the welcome article and the About page as
flat files directly under `content/`, and `gala/repository.json` declares a
single `contentRoots` entry (`kind: article`, `path: content`) matching the
one `publish-action` actually reads — the same shape as
`publish/packages/publish-action/test/fixtures/minimal-repository`. `kind`
on each file's own frontmatter (`article`/`page`) is what actually
distinguishes an article from a page; the directory does not. When
`publish-action` implements subdirectory content roots, this user template (and
its `repository.json`) should move to `content/articles/`/`content/pages/`
and this note should be deleted.

## Optional `gala/modules/analytics.json`

The template repository ships no `analytics.json`; an author adds
`gala/modules/analytics.json` to enable analytics. Contract (schemas 3.16.0,
closed objects):

```json
{
  "schemaId": "urn:gala:schema:analytics-config:2.0.0",
  "schemaVersion": "2.0.0",
  "provider": { "kind": "google-analytics-4", "measurementId": "G-ABC123XYZ" },
  "consent": { "policy": "opt-in" }
}
```

`G-ABC123XYZ` is a placeholder: replace it with the site's own GA4 measurement
id.

The built site shows a consent banner and loads Google Analytics 4 only after
the reader accepts.

## `gala/theme-pages/`: the mandatory pages

`content/` holds only the author's own posts and pages. The site's mandatory
pages live in `gala/theme-pages/`: `about.md` (a content document with front
matter, `kind: page`, `slug: about`, rendered at `/about`), `terms.md` and
`privacy.md`. Galascribe manages the folder: it restores a missing file and
never overwrites one the author edited. Nothing mandatory is kept under
`content/`, and the verifier checks that `content/about.md` does not exist.

### Terms and Privacy text

`gala/publication.json` carries a `policies` member (schemas 3.16.0) naming a
title and a repository-relative Markdown body for each page:

```json
"policies": {
  "terms": { "title": "Terms", "body": "gala/theme-pages/terms.md" },
  "privacy": { "title": "Privacy", "body": "gala/theme-pages/privacy.md" }
}
```

`terms.md` and `privacy.md` are the site's editable
Terms and Privacy text (also editable in the App under Settings → Legal pages),
and they are not placeholders: Galascribe's generation step leaves them as
shipped. They are seeded from `@rathnasgala2/schemas/site-policy-defaults`
(`site-policy-defaults.json` at the schemas package root), the same defaults
the App's "Reset to default" and the template's fallback use.

Seed rule: each file is the export's `markdown` member for that page, byte for
byte, plus a single trailing newline when the member does not already end in
one; each title in `publication.json` equals the export's `title`. Refresh the
files whenever the schemas version in `gala.lock.json` moves. The verifier's
"policy seeds equal the schemas defaults" check enforces this.

The template generates `/terms` and `/privacy` from these two files, appends
its own non-editable Galascribe section to both, and generates the legal
footer. Authors must not create content with the slugs `terms` or `privacy`.

## `gala.lock.json`: local generation-4 release candidate

There is no `resolve` command in `publish-action`; its CLI exposes `validate`,
`build`, and `preview`. The generation-4 lock is therefore derived from the
workspace packages with `npm pack --ignore-scripts`, and every recorded SHA-256
is the digest of the resulting local tarball. No zero or invented integrity is
used. Its schema/template/theme selection is
`@rathnasgala2/schemas@3.19.0`, `@rathnasgala2/template@4.4.0`, and
`@rathnasgala2/theme-default@4.2.0`.

**SOURCE-ONLY DELIVERY:** schema 3.19.0, template 4.4.1, Default 4.2.0, and the
publish action are bound to byte-reproducible local tarballs. The publish action
vendors and verifies the complete generation-4 toolchain before installation,
so this delivery does not require or perform npm publication. The
`https://local-development.invalid/rathnasgala2/` values deliberately identify
that non-registry provenance and must not be rewritten to npm URLs without a
separate registry-release decision.

The reusable-workflow caller pins immutable Publish generation-4 release commit
`fe025a1c8a02ef937b8c4d12e01b1c9ee067a127` in both fields. Never replace it
with a mutable branch or an invented SHA.

## Verifying

```sh
nvm use 24.18.0
node .user-template/scripts/verify-user-template.mjs
```

Resolves the `schema`, `template`, `theme-default`, `publish`, and `api`
checkouts from `WORKSPACE_ROOT` when set, otherwise from the fixed relative
workspace root (`v2/` for this checkout). Verification repacks every locked
source package, compares every SHA-256, validates the lock's self-digest,
requires both policy seed files and titles to equal the `schema` checkout's
`site-policy-defaults` export, and requires the API's current-template fixture
to remain byte-identical.
